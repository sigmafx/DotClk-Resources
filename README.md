First Frame:
If 'Blank', 'Frame Delay' should be 1000
If non blank 'Frame Delay' is required, delay should always be 2000

Last Frame:
If 'Blank', 'Frame Delay' should be 1000
If non blank 'Frame Delay' is required, delay should always be 2000
Do not select 'Blank' and 'Clock On Top' simultaneously as this is meaningless and will cause confusion
