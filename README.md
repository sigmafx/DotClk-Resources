# Scene Creation Guidelines
##### First Frame
If *Blank* is set, 'Frame Delay' should be 1000ms.
If *Blank* is **not** set and *Frame Delay* is required, delay should be 2000ms.
Do not select *Blank* and *Clock On Top* simultaneously as this is meaningless and will cause confusion.
##### Last Frame
If *Blank* is set, 'Frame Delay' should be 1000ms
If  *Blank* is **not** set and *Frame Delay* is required, delay should be 2000ms.
Do not select *Blank* and *Clock On Top* simultaneously as this is meaningless and will cause confusion.
